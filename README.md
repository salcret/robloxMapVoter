# robloxMapVoter
Very basic map voting gui.
How to set up:
Downloading the linked file, and opening it, will bring you to a baseplate.
Please do not touch or move anything, unless you know how to fix it!
Different settings (timers etc) can be found at the start of different scripts. To change the values, simply open the script and change
the values to whatever you want.

To make a new map, group your map (so it's a model) and put it in the 'Maps' folder in ReplicatedStorage.
Then, in the 'MapVoting' gui (and frame), create a new button (in the 'Maps' frame) by cloning one of the existing buttons.
Change the button's name to your map's name, as well as the textlabel displaying the map name.


That's all for now! 
Any bugs, tweet me @salcret!
